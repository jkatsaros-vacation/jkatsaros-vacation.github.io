Disney's Magical Express is no more, which means we'll have to figure out some other way of getting between the MCO airport and our chosen resort.  Luckily, we have some options outside of the traditional taxis that inhabit the airports.

Both the Mears Connect and Sunshine Flyer services filled the void left by the defunct Disney's Magical Express with their own flair of charter buses.  They offer one way and round trip fares, which is unlike the Uber/Lyft one way only services.  However, the Mears Connect and Sunshine Flyer services both charge per person, whereas the Uber/Lyft route only charge for the overall trip.

## <span style="color:red">Personal Opinions:</span>

I don't have any experience with the Mears Connect nor the Sunshine Flyer services, though I was fortunate enough to use Disney's Magical Express while it was still running. Disney's Magical Express was great; they took care of retrieving your luggage from your arrival flight, played Disney shows and infomercials to get you in the magical mindset, and put your luggage back on your departing flight. Best of all: It was included in the cost of the vacation.

I don't have any personal preference on whether the charter bus services or the taxi services are better or worse, so I'll put some helpful points to try to help make the decision easier.

## <span style="color:blue">Helpful Considerations:</span>

- Using Mears Connect or The Sunshine Flyer means that we'll all be able to travel together to our destination.
- Using Uber/Lyft might be more cost effective than the Mears Connect or Sunshine Flyer charter buses.
- Using Mears Connect or The Sunshine Flyer gives extra perks, such as souveniers and trip entertainment.
- Using Uber/Lyft means that we can leave as soon as our vehicle arrives to pick us up.
- Using Uber/Lyft means that we go directly to our destination, with no stops along the way.
- Using Uber/Lyft gives more flexibility around the ending portion of the vacation.
