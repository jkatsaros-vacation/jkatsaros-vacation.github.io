## <span style="color:red">Personal Opinions:</span>

According to data collected by [Touring Plans](https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels), Disney World goers are happiest when they choose Disney Deluxe Resorts over their other counterparts for a variety of reasons. I feel like monorail access is a great selling point for these hotels, as it better enables park hopping and Magic Hour usage and allows for easier and longer down times in between attractions and other appointments.

For example, each trip utilizing the monorail takes about 10 to 15 minutes; 5 minutes of waiting at the monorail station, either at the park or at the hotel, then 5 to 10 minutes of travelling. In contrast, each trip taking the bus sometimes takes about a half hour to an hour one way. Buses are often full, and there are times where filled buses come and go without accepting any new passengers, causing you to wait for a second or third bus.

This seems to me a particularly large consideration for something like nap time. Staying at a monorail resort allows for flexibility to take nap time(s) throughout the day in an instant, whereas other resorts require some amount of anticipation when it comes to naps, and they might not be as easily taken.

## <span style="color:blue">Helpful Considerations:</span>

- The monorail is the fastest transportation option, but is accessible by the least amount of hotels.
- Value resorts have access to the least amount of transportation options, which contribute to long wait times and travel times in between parks and hotels.
- Magic Kingdom can be accessed by:

  - Monorail
  - Boat
  - Bus
  - Walking (from the Contemporary Resort)
- EPCOT can be accessed by:
  - Monorail
  - Boat
  - Skyliner
  - Bus
  - Walking (from the Beach Club Resort, Yacht Club Resort, and Boardwalk Inn)
- Disney's Hollywood Studios can be accessed by:
  - Boat
  - Skyliner
  - Bus
- Animal Kingdom can be accessed by:
  - Bus
