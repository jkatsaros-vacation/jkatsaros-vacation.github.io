## [The Best Times To Go To Disney World In 2023](https://www.undercovertourist.com/blog/best-time-to-visit-disney-world/)

- Jan. 18 â€“ Feb. 15
- March 1-8
- The second half of April
- Weekdays in the first half of May
- The second half of August
- Most days in September
- Most weekdays in October
- Weekdays in November (minus the week of Thanksgiving)
- Weekdays in December (minus the weeks of Christmas and New Year's Eve)


## <span style="color:red">Personal Opinions:</span>

According to the Undercover Tourist blog, as well as the data above, it seems to me like the best time for us to go would be May, since it yields a nice balance between crowd levels and temperature. Lower crowd levels not only gives us the benefit of easier and more frequent access to the rides and attractions we want to visit, but it also allows us to book the hotel we want to stay in, go between parks and nap time more easily, eat as a large party together at the restaurants we want to try, and enjoy the transportation around Disney World at a more relaxed pace. The rest of the months overlap with summer vacation for most (if not all) school districts, which means more people, busier parks, more crowded restaurants, and harder to get hotel bookings.

## <span style="color:blue">Helpful Considerations:</span>

- If park crowds is the deciding factor for when we should go on this vacation, consider the following:
  - Animal Kingdom is not part of the boat nor the monorail nor the new Skyliner systems, which means you can only travel to Animal Kingdom via bus or Minnie Van (Lyft).
  - Besides Animal Kingdom, which has some of the newest and most popular rides at Disney World, Magic Kingdom is by far the busiest of the parks, since it's the most iconic location at Disney World.
  - Larger crowd levels means more people using electric scooters, which bogs down the transportation systems as well as the ride queues.
- If temperature is the deciding factor for when we should go on this vacation, consider the following:
  - Animal Kingdom is known for its lack of shade, as well as being designed like a giant bowl. This means that Animal Kingdom can get hot and stay hot for extended periods of time.

# When Should We Book?

Typically, you are allowed to book a Disney World room-only reservation over the phone 499 days in advance of your stay at the following toll-free phone number: **(407) 939-1936**. Patrons staying on-site at Disney World can make dining reservations 60 days before their stay at their Disney World resort commences. Everybody else can make dining reservations 60 days in advance from the day of their dining appointment.

We can request our favored Disney World Villa starting any time if we decide to utilize the Dave's Vacation Club Rental service.

This means that we can book our hotel room whenever we decide on where we want to stay!
