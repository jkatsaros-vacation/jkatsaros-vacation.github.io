# Introduction

Hello! I wanted to put together some of my thoughts and opinions for potential Disney World 2023 vacation options.

I broke this document into four parts:

- How: How do we get to and from Florida and Disney World?
- When: When should we go to Disney World and when can we book our vacation?
- Where: Where should we stay in Disney World and where should we eat in Disney World?
- What: What should we do in Disney World?

When making this document I made the following assumptions:

- I am assuming a one week trip.
- I am assuming that we are not staying outside of Disney World.
- I am assuming that we are not renting cars.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to explore any of these options further!
